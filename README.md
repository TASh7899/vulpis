# Vulpis

A lightweight UI engine built with C++ and Lua, focused on declarative syntax, layout simplicity, and real-time rendering.

Vulpis provides a small but powerful framework for building user interfaces using Lua while handling rendering, layout, and style resolution in C++. The goal is to offer a clean developer experience where UI is defined in Lua with a React-like declarative structure, while the engine handles layout, drawing, and updates efficiently.
